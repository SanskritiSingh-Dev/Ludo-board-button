# Practice of Object + States with an example

A simple **React-based move counter** that tracks moves for each player in a Ludo game — Blue, Red, Green, and Yellow. This project demonstrates the use of `useState`, object state updates, and inline styling in React.

- Clicking a button increases that player's move count by 1.
- All counts are stored in a single object in state using `useState({})`.
- The `...prevMove` syntax ensures only the updated field changes.
